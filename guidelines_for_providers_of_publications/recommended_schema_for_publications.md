## â€‹Recommended schema for publications {#recommended-schema-for-publications}

This section includes the overview of the recommended OMTD-SHARE schema for publications, i.e. the subset of M(andatory) and strongly R(ecommended) metadata elements, only as regards elements related to the resource itself. Additional elements required for the management of the metadata record (e.g. _metadataCreationDate, metadataCreator_ etc.) are not presented here, as they are to be handled by the OMTD platform.
