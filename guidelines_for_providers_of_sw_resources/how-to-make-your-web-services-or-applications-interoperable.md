### How to make your web services or applications interoperable {#how-to-make-your-web-services-or-applications-interoperable}

In addition, if you want to be fully compliant with the OpenMinTeD interoperability requirements, please ensure that you adopt the following rules; if you fail to abide to them, it might still be possible to operate your s/w resources via the OpenMinTeD platform, but this cannot be guaranteed and interoperability with other resources will suffer loss.

In addition, when OpenMinTeD web services are hosted on GRNET&#039;s cloud service, they are limited by the ~okeanos resource management contemporaneous constraints and policies, i.e. each service being deployed at a Docker-enabled VM:

*   can only run on a ~okeanos-supported host operating system, more information here: [https://okeanos.grnet.gr/support/faq/okeanos-what-operating-systems-are-available-to-install-on-my-vms/](https://okeanos.grnet.gr/support/faq/okeanos-what-operating-systems-are-available-to-install-on-my-vms/)
*   cannot surpass the CPU/Cores/Disk limit imposed by ~okeanos and by the ~okeanos OMTD project in total.
