#### version
##### Usage
Recommended
##### Definition/Explanations
Any string, usually a number, that identifies the version of a resource
##### Recommended usage
For components, the recommended practice is to follow the semantic versioning (http://semver.org/). N.B. "version" should not be confused with the relation that links together a specific resource with its various enriched or modified versions (e.g. annotated version, subset etc.).
