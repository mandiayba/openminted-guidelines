## How to share your knowledge resources {#How-to-share-your knowledge-resources}

Ancillary knowledge resources can be uploaded by registered users as decided in the OpenMinTeD Policies.

If you wish to share such a resource, depending on the mode of registering the resource, the following requirements are in order:

*   if the resource is being provided for upload to the OpenMinTeD registry, please package it as a zip file preserving the recommended folder structure
*   if the resource is available as part of a Maven artifact, please provide the appropriate Maven coordinates
*   if the resource is offered with a SPARQL endpoint or at a URL, please type in the relevant link.

In all cases, you must also

*   provide a metadata record compliant with the OMTD-SHARE schema.

Where possible, e.g. in the case of providing a Maven artifact, metadata may be, at least partially, converted from the existing descriptors. In all cases, you will be notified of the availability of converted metadata at the time of uploading.
