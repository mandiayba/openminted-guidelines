* if the licence you use is not included in the list, you can use the "nonStandardLicenceTerms" or the "proprietary" values and give further information on your licence in the elements: "nonStandardLicenceName", "nonStandardLicenceTermsURL" and "nonStandardLicenceTermsText"
* you can also use the "rightsStatementName" and the "rightsStatementURL" \(with a link to a URL with more explanations on its usage\) if the resource is provided with a general statement of use and not an official licence document; please, note that this is an option used mainly to facilitate end-users in accessing your resource, while you are strongly advised to properly license your resource.
