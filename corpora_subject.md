##### Recommended usage
It is recommended that the subjects are taken from an authoritative source, such as DDC (Dewey Decimal Classification, http://www.oclc.org/dewey/) or UDC (Universal Decimal Classification, http://www.udcc.org/) and that the source is identified; if you do, please use the classificationSchemeName to indicate the source; if this is not included in the list of values, please use "schemeURI" with a link to a URL with more information on the scheme. 
The recommended way of adding the subject values is the identifier of the subject in the scheme; further instructions on the standardization of the format will be provided.
