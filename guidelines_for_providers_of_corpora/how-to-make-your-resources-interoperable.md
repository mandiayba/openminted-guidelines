### How to make your resources interoperable {#how-to-make-your-resources-interoperable}

There are no general requirements yet for corpora to be used for ancillary purposes, as these are dependent on the requirements of the s/w components that will use them and on the purpose of use.

For corpora that will be used for TDM, the requirements are the same with the ones set for corpora produced automatically through user queries in the OpenMinTeD platform to the extent possible - repeated hereafter. For legacy corpora, especially, not all requirements and recommendations can be enforced, but for new corpora, the adoption of standards, best practices and recommendations promoted by OpenMinTeD and other infrastructures should be taken into account from the early steps of design and specifications.

Please, note that the list below is meant to provide recommendations that contribute to interoperability; if you fail to abide to them, it might still be possible to process your corpora via the OpenMinTeD platform, but this cannot be guaranteed and interoperability with other resources will suffer loss.

*   The preferred formats for delivering textual material are plain txt, xml, pdf (not proprietary and certainly not of scanned images), which can be read by one of the existing readers.
*   If appropriate for your material, use one of the more specific data formats that are already covered by readers and converters (pending link)
*   The preferred character encoding is UTF-8.
