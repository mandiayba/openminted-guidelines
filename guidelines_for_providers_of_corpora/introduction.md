## â€‹Introduction {#introduction}

OpenMinTeD aspires to facilitate the use of TDM technologies in the scientific publications world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to literature related to specific disciplines.

Corpora in the OpenMinTeD framework refer mainly to the collections of publications that will be used as mining source in the TDM process. In fact, the OpenMinTeD platform includes a mechanism for automatically generating corpora based on user criteria selected from a faceted view of all publications provided by the OpenMinTeD partners - more details are included in the **_Guidelines for publications_**.

Corpora may also come from repositories of language resources, such as META-SHARE and CLARIN, or discipline-specific repositories, in which case they do not have to be composed of scholarly publications. Examples include reference corpora (i.e. corpora deemed representative of general language or a sublanguage usage), news corpora, collections of domain-specific texts, such as manuals, etc. as well as annotated corpora, such as treebanks, morphologically tagged golden corpora etc. These corpora are not targeted as source of mining but can be used for training components (e.g. train a language model) or for evaluating their performance or for ancillary purposes.

To be valid for import into OpenMinTeD, all corpora must be accompanied with a metadata record conformant with the OMTD-SHARE schema<sup><sup id="916464963798167-footnote-ref-19"><a href="#916464963798167-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup>, and a file with the contents must be uploaded or made accessible for uploading.

The following sections present a list of requirements and recommendations that corpora must meet to interact with TDM resources. **Please, note that this list will continue to be updated and visit the site often to find more recommendations and advice.**
