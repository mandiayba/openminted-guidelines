## â€‹Instructions for providers of web services and end-user applications {#instructions-for-providers-of-web-services-and-end-user-applications}



### ****Documentation/Metadata requirements**** {#documentation-metadata-requirements}

To be fully compatible with OpenMinTeD, you must

*   ensure that the s/w is distributed under a perpetual, world-wide, no-charge, royalty-free copyright/patent license that permits unrestricted use and allows unlimited redistribution
*   include in the metadata record a link to the licence document(s) with the terms and conditions under which it is provided, and attach the licence document(s) together with the resource
*   if you already have a PID for your resource (e.g. a URI or a HANDLE), make sure it is included in the metadata record
*   ensure that you version all your s/w resources and label the versions in an unambiguous way, preferably following the Semantic Versioning recommendations[^36].

Further recommendations that contribute to interoperability include the following:

*   It is important that you provide the appropriate documentation for your resource (e.g. manuals, help files etc.), which you should also version along with the s/w and add as reference to your metadata record.
*   Describe all the executional requirements for the proper operation of the s/w, i.e. required s/w libraries, ancillary resources, annotation schema dependencies etc.
*   Describe the input and output requirements for your s/w, at least as regards the type of resource, the language (if required), data format and character encoding, and annotation types of the input/output resource.
*   Declare that the s/w can only be accessed as a web service in the metadata.
*   Ensure that you describe appropriately the functionalities of the s/w, both through the OMTD-SHARE component type vocabulary (pending link) as well as in a free text description, supplying more information for the user.
*   In all cases, where linking to other resources or entities (e.g. persons, projects etc.), please try to do this through unique and persistent identifiers of authority lists and sources, to the extent possible, documenting also the authority and/or scheme it adheres to.
