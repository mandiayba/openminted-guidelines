## Instructions for publication repositories, libraries, journals, publishers, etc. {#instructions-for-publication-repositories-libraries-journals-publishers-etc}

### Uploading instructions {#uploading-instructions}

If you wish to share publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through OpenMinTeD, you can do so

*   by registering through OpenAIRE, following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)
*   by registering through CORE, following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)

For each publication to be valid for import into OpenMinTeD, a metadata record conformant with the OMTD-SHARE schema<sup id="916464963798167-footnote-ref-10"><a href="#916464963798167-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup>, and a file with the contents must be delivered.

### Technical requirements {#technical-requirements}

To be fully compatible with OpenMinTeD, you must:

*   provide a file with the actual contents of each publication in any format you desire (e.g. PDF, HTML, etc.).

In addition, if you wish your material to be easily processable and interoperable with TDM tools and services, you should adopt the following recommendations. Please, note that not all of these are absolute requirements: if your material is not compliant with them, it may still be processable, but their adoption makes it better equipped for TDM and NLP processing.

*   The preferred formats for delivering textual material are plain txt, xml, pdf (not proprietary and certainly not of scanned images), which can be read by one of the existing readers.
*   If appropriate for your material, use one of the more specific data formats that are already supported by readers and converters included in the OpenMinTeD registry (pending link).
*   The preferred character encoding is UTF-8.

### Documentation/Metadata requirements {#documentation-metadata-requirements}

To be fully compatible with OpenMinTeD, you must

*   provide a metadata record for each publication with at least bibliographic information about it, in preference following the OpenAIRE or CORE guidelines
*   ensure that the publications are distributed under Open Access conditions
*   include in the metadata record of each publication a link to the licence document that describes the terms and conditions under which it is provided, and attach the licence document together with the publication
*   if you already have a PID for your publication (preferably DOI), make sure it is included in the metadata record.

The following recommendations will help interaction of your resources, but they are not mandatory.

*   Further adoption of standards such as the [JATS article tag suite](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/index.html) or [TEI P5 guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/) for annotating the inner structure of publications is recommended.
*   Use standard classification vocabularies, such as [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), [DDC](https://www.oclc.org/dewey.en.html), [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) etc.) for adding classification tags to your material and specify the vocabulary you use in the metadata record; give at least one broad category for your material (e.g. life sciences, computing etc.).
*   In all cases, where linking to other resources or entities (e.g. persons, projects etc.) in the metadata records is added, please try to do this through unique and persistent identifiers of authority lists and sources, to the extent possible, documenting also the authority and/or scheme it adheres to.
