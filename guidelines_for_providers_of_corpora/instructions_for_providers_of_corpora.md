*   in an unprocessed format and annotated by the operation of TDM software also registered in the platform and/or
*   in an already processed format; in this case, they must be included as a separate resource with its own metadata record including a specific set of metadata elements (the same as for annotated publications).

It should be noted that corpora annotated by means of the OpenMinTeD platform will be automatically assigned the appropriate values for these elements.
