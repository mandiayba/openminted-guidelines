## â€‹Recommended schema for corpora {#recommended-schema-for-corpora}

### Overview {#overview}

This section includes a synopsis of the minimal schema for corpora<sup><sup id="916464963798167-footnote-ref-27"><a href="#916464963798167-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></sup>, i.e. the subset of M(andatory) and strongly R(ecommended) metadata elements. Additional elements required for the management of the metadata record (e.g. _metadataCreationDate, metadataCreator_ etc.) are not presented here, as they are to be handled by the OMTD platform.

### Metadata schema for annotated corpora {#metadata-schema-for-annotated-corpora}

Annotated corpora are documented as separate resources

*   including only the annotated data, with a link to the raw corpus and its own set of metadata elements providing information on the annotation process, tool etc. or
*   as a set of raw and annotated files together, with a metadata record that includes all the appropriate elements for raw corpora (cf. above) with the additional set of metadata elements for annotations, i.e. all the following elements except for &quot;resourceIdentifier&quot;.
