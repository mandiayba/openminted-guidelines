## â€‹Instructions for aggregators {#instructions-for-openaire-and-core}

OpenAIRE and CORE will bring content resources into OpenMinTeD through user queries.

End-users that wish to run TDM services on specific content will be presented with a faceted view of the OpenAIRE and CORE contents; by selecting from a range of criteria, a query will gradually be built which will be transferred to the respective APIs and retrieve the metadata records and data files of the matching publications. It should be noted that

****only publications that provide the full text or, at least, an abstract are candidate for inclusion in OpenMinTeD.****

For each new corpus created according to this procedure, an automatically generated metadata record will be produced which will be submitted to the user for further editing.
