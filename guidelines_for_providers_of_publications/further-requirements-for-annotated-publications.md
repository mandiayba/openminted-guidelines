Scholarly publications will normally be imported into the OpenMinTeD platform in an unprocessed format and will be annotated by the operation of TDM software also registered in the platform. 

However, certain providers may decide to run the TDM or annotation software at their own premises and upload the results of the processing directly into OpenMinTeD (e.g. annotating the publications with structural markup, extracting acknowledgements or citations sections etc.). 

In these cases, the annotated output is considered a new resource and, therefore, should be uploaded
* as a separate resource from the raw publication in a folder called "annotated files"
* with its own metadata record, following the instructions for annotated publications.

It should be noted that publications annotated by means of the OpenMinTeD platform will be automatically assigned the appropriate values for these elements.
